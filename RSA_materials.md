## NEXSYS4DDR EXPERIEMENT SETUP

The NEXSYS4DDR board is a development platform based on the latest Artix-7 FPGA from Xilinx. With its high-capacity FPGA and its massive external memory, the Nexys has the capacity to host designs ranging from basic combinational circuits to large embedded processors. The board that this project is supported for is the Nexys A7 100T. The components that were used on the NEXSYS4DDR include the micro-usb port (labeled as PROG UART) for UART and the VGA port for the VGA.

## RSA Introduction 

As embedded devices, such as phones and computers, are increasingly being used in network communication,  the amount of data transfer also tends to increase. This massive increase of data transfer brings an additional requirement of protection against unauthorized access on these data transfers. This is where RSA comes into play. RSA is one of the oldest and most widely used public-key algorithms for secure data transmission through unsecured channels. RSA is still being used in various web browsers, emails, VPN's, and other channels of communication.
